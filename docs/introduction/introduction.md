# Rasterex Web SDK 

Rasterex Web SDK is a JavaScript based library that is created to enable viewing and annotating using a large variety of file formats. This is accomplished using a server back-end that provides processed data based on the original file format. 

We render content using using HTML5 canvas for 2D formats and WebGL for 3D formats.
Rasterex Web SDK is compatible with most modern browsers. 

The web client can read the following formats natively.
- PNG, used for pixel based formats, like TIFF, BMP and JPEG.
- Rx2B, our propietary binary format used for all vector based formats like DWG and DGN.
- PDF used for PDF and Office formats like MS Word, MS Excel and others.
