The alignment process is distinct from editing and can be accessed through the **Edit menu** located at the top left-hand corner of the document viewer. This feature ensures that compared files are properly aligned for accurate results.

---

#### Accessing the Alignment Tool  
1. **Edit Menu**:  
   - Click on the **Edit** menu in the top-left corner.  
    <img src={aligncomparison2} alt="aligncomparison2" />

   - Select the **Align** option from the expandable list.

2. **Align Mode Activation**:  
    <img src={aligncomparison3} alt="aligncomparison3" />

   - Upon activation, the viewer displays each document in a row, enabling users to utilize the alignment tool to set points for improved comparison.

---

#### Using the Alignment Tool  
- **X and Y Axes**:  
  - The tool features X and Y axes along with a **central square** indicating where the first alignment point should be placed.  
  - Users can choose any part of the drawing they consider essential for alignment.

- **Snap Feature**:  
    <img src={aligncomparison4} alt="aligncomparison4" />

  - The square can snap to various parts of the drawing, enhancing precision and ensuring accurate placement of alignment points.

1. **First Alignment Point**:  
    <img src={aligncomparison5} alt="aligncomparison5" />

   - Set the first point on the first document.  
   - The tool then requests the next alignment point, creating a line used as a reference for alignment.

2. **Second Alignment Point**:  
   - Repeat the process on the second document to complete the alignment.

#### Generating Aligned Comparison  
    <img src={aligncomparison6} alt="aligncomparison6" />

- Once all points are set:  
  - The comparison is regenerated with the updated alignment.  
  - The **UI is locked** and a progress bar displays the alignment process.  
  - Upon completion, the newly aligned comparison appears in the viewer, and the loader is dismissed.

---

#### Additional Alignment Options  
    <img src={aligncomparison7} alt="aligncomparison7" />

- Users can repeat the alignment process multiple times until they are satisfied with the results.  
- **Note**: Once a markup is placed on the canvas, further alignment adjustments are disabled, and only saving options are available.
