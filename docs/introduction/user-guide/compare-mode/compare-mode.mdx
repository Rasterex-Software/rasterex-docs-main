In compare mode, the viewer's UI adjusts to display only the tools and information relevant to the comparison activity, hiding any redundant tools. The **header** and **compare tile** are described in the "Top Navigation" section, while details on the **compare toolbar** are found in the "Toolbar (Compare)" subchapter. Below are the unique elements specific to compare mode:

---

#### 1. **Edit Comparison Menu / Save Comparison Menu**  
- **Edit Comparison Menu**:  
  - Allows users to change the order of the files and adjust colors.  
    <img src={editcomparisonmenu} alt="editcomparisonmenu" />

  - Provides access to the **Align** menu for initiating comparison alignment.
  
- **Save Comparison Menu**:  
  - When markups are added, the button changes to **Save Comparison**, enabling users to:  
    - Save the comparison  
    - Export the files  
    - Perform both actions

---

#### 2. **Revision Cloud (Annotate Toolbar)**  
 <img src={revisioncloud} alt="revisioncloud" />

- This toolbar resembles the one used in annotation mode but offers only the **Revision Cloud** tool.  
- Detailed information about the revision cloud's items and interactions is available in the "Annotate Toolbar" section.

#### 3. **Tutorial**  
 <img src={tutorial} alt="tutorial" />

- **Tutorial Icon**:

### Comparison Generation  

The comparison is generated by sending a **CommandJSON** command to the **Rasterex API**. The **WebClientPublish** method is used to present the comparison drawing once it is ready.
