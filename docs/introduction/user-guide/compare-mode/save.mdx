title: Save Comparison

import save1 from "./img/save/save1.png";
import save2 from "./img/save/save2.png";
import save3 from "./img/save/save3.png";
import save4 from "./img/save/save4.png";
import save5 from "./img/save/save5.png";


Once the **first markup** is added to the document, the ability to **edit** or **align** the comparison is disabled. This is to prevent markups from being lost or misaligned relative to their original positions. Consequently, the **"Edit"** button is replaced by the **"Save"** button.

#### Save Options in the Standalone Viewer

When a user clicks the **Save** button, the following options are available:

1. **Save**:  
   - Saves the generated comparison file, including the markups, to the RX server using the `WebClientSaveMarkup` method from `RxCSISAPI.dll`.

2. **Export PDF**:  
    <img src={save2} alt="save2" />

   - Saves the comparison file and opens a PDF version in a new tab.  
   - The PDF can be downloaded to the local machine, leveraging the same `WebClientSaveMarkup` method.

3. **Save and Export**:  
    <img src={save3} alt="save3" />

   - Combines both **Save** and **Export PDF** functions.  
   - Saves the changes to the server and simultaneously opens the PDF with the generated markups in a new tab for download.

#### Unsaved Changes Alert Modal  
<img src={save4} alt="save4" />

If a user attempts to close the comparison without saving, a modal window appears with the following options:

1. **Cancel/Close Icon**:  
   - Cancels the closing action and dismisses the modal, allowing users to continue working without saving.

2. **Discard**:  
   - Discards all changes made since the last save and closes the comparison without saving any markups.

3. **Save**:  
    <img src={save5} alt="save5" />

   - Saves the comparison file, including all markups, using the previously described save methods.

#### Notes on Saving Behavior

- This saving process is specific to the **standalone viewer**.  
- When the viewer is launched within the **ExSys** environment, the saving workflow may differ, as detailed in a separate chapter of the document.
