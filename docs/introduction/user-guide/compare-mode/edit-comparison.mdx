Editing the comparison is accessible via the **floating button** located in the bottom left-hand corner of the main viewer. This allows users to modify certain aspects of the comparison, such as file order and color settings.

#### Accessing Comparison Editing  
1. **Floating Button**:  
   - Click the arrow on the floating button to reveal available options.  
    <img src={editcomparison2} alt={"editcomparison2"} />

   - Select the **Edit** option from the menu.

2. **Edit Pop-up**:  
   - Once selected, a pop-up appears, allowing users to modify the comparisonâ€™s basic properties (e.g., order and colors).  
   - Unlike the create compare flow, file selection changes are not possible in this mode.  
   - Detailed information on this modal is outlined in the "Create Compare" subchapter.

#### Modifying the Comparison  
- **Apply Button**:  
    <img src={editcomparison3} alt={"editcomparison3"} />

  - After making changes, click the **Apply** button to regenerate the comparison.  
  - The UI will display a **progress bar** while the updated comparison is being generated.  
  - Once the server returns the updated file, it will be displayed in the viewer.

- **Cancel Button**:  
  - To dismiss changes without applying them, click the **Cancel** button.

#### Markup Layer Modifications  
- If any changes are made to the markup layer, the editing option will be disabled and replaced with **saving options**.
