<img src={toolbarCompare} alt="Toolbar Comapare" />
<img src={toolbar3d} alt="Toolbar 3d" />

The toolbar provides access to basic file navigation, view options, and interactions with the file content, where applicable. It adapts to three principal modes based on the type of file being viewed:

1. **Viewing a 2D File**  
2. **Viewing a Comparison**  
3. **Viewing a 3D File**  

In each case, the toolbar dynamically adjusts its elements to reflect the options available for the specific file format and view mode.

---

## Toolbar (2D)

### **Select Text**
<img src={selectText1} alt="selectText1" />

- Lets users select and highlight portions of the document's text, enabling tasks like copying.
<img src={selectText2} alt="selectText2" />

---

### **Search Text**
<img src={searchText1} alt="selectText1" />

The "Search Text" tool allows users to search for specific keywords or phrases within the text content of the document. It makes use of the `RxCore.textSearch` and `RxCore.endTextSearch` methods, which initiate and end the search process in the SDK.

<img src={searchText2} alt="selectText2" />

Clicking on the "Search Text" tool opens up the search text modal, where a user can enter the query for search and interact with the results.

<img src={searchText3} alt="selectText3" />

Once search is initiated, the matching terms will be highlighted in the document for easier identification of matches.

- The search text modal contains the following elements.:
  - **Search Input**: A field for entering search queries.

### Grayscale Slider  

<img src={grayScale} alt="grayScale" />

The grayscale slide option allows a user to access the slider, which lets one adjust the level of the visibility of similar parts of the drawings in the compare mode. When this icon is clicked, the slider interface gets presented.  
<img src={grayScaleSlider} alt="grayScaleSlider" />

The slider provides three positions for adjusting the level of grayscaling:

- **Level 3**  
  Applies the level of grayscaling to the value, which makes the differences between the drawings and overlapping parts fully visible.  
  Sets the `EqualColor: "rgb(128,128,128)"` value in `CommandJSON`. This results in a comparison output where differences are clearly highlighted. The output result will be as presented below.
  <img src={grayScaleLevel3} alt="grayScaleLevel3" />

- **Level 2**  
  Creates the semi-transparent effect of the visibility of the common parts of the drawings.  
  Sets the `EqualColor: "rgb(200,200,200)"` value in `CommandJSON`. It creates the comparison output with a partially visible overlap between the drawings. The output example is shown below.
  <img src={grayScaleLevel2} alt="grayScaleLevel2" />

- **Level 1**  
  Applies the level of grayscaling to the value, which only makes the differences between the drawings visible.  
  Sets the `EqualColor: "rgb(255,255,255)"` value in `CommandJSON`. The result of the comparison in this case will appear as in the below example.
  <img src={grayScaleLevel1} alt="grayScaleLevel1" />
