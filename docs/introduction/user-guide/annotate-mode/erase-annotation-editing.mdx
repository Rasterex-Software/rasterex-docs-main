When a user clicks on the edit shortcut related to the annotation of the erase type, one will get presented with the same modal window as is available on erase markup creation.
	
This modal contains the slider that allows one to modify the sickness of the eraserâ€™s line with the help of a slider allowing to pick a value in a range of 0-12 pts.
