title: Saving the Annotations

import savingTheAnnotations from "./img/saving-the-annotations/saving-the-annotations.png"
import success from "./img/saving-the-annotations/success.png"


In the current implementation of the annotate mode there is no dynamic saving of the markups. Thus a user is supposed to confirm and save changes manually.

<img src={savingTheAnnotations} alt="savingTheAnnotations" />

This can be achieved with the “Save” button in the hamburger menu. 

<img src={success} alt="success" />

Upon a successful save operation a user will be presented with the toast respective message.
