The **Info** tab is available in the editing modal for all markup types except for:  
- **Measure Annotations**  
- **Arrow Annotations**

This tab provides essential details about the markup, including the following characteristics:  

1. **Author**  
   - Displays the name of the user who created or authored the markup.

2. **GUID**  
   - A unique identifier associated with the markup for tracking purposes.

3. **Layer**  
   - Indicates the layer to which the markup belongs.

4. **Page**  
   - Specifies the document page or location where the markup is located.

5. **Count** (for count annotations only)  
   - Shows the numerical count associated with the count annotations, providing quantitative information.

6. **Time**  
   - Displays the timestamp when the markup was created or last modified.

7. **Type**  
   - Identifies the type or category of the markup, distinguishing it from other annotations.

### Purpose of the "Info" Tab  
By presenting these basic characteristics, the **Info** tab enables users to:  
- Gain insights into the origin and properties of the markup.  
- Understand the context of the annotation within the document.  
- Effectively manage markups for better document organization.
