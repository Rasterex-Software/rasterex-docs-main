### Length Measurement Editing  
<!--<img src={lengthMeasurement} alt="lengthMeasurement" />-->

The **Length Measurement Annotation** editing modal allows users to view and modify the following styling properties:  
- **Line Type**: Users can select the desired line style.  
- **Colors**: Users can change the color of the measurement line using predefined colors or a custom color picker.  
- **Snapping Preferences**: Users can toggle the snapping feature, determining whether the measurement line adheres to specific elements within the document.

The **edit modal** mirrors the UI and functionality of the **Length Measurement Creation** process, which is described in the "Annotate Toolbar" chapter of the document.

### Path/Area Measurement Editing  
<!--<img src={areaMeasurement} alt="areaMeasurement" />-->

The **Path and Area Measurement** editing modal provides options to manage the annotation's styling and snapping properties, including:  
- **Color**: Users can select or customize the color of the measurement lines.  
- **Line Thickness**: Users can adjust the thickness of the lines using a slider (0â€“12 pts).  
- **Line Style**: Users can choose from various predefined line styles.  
- **Snapping Preferences**: Users can enable or disable snapping to align the annotation with document elements.

Similar to the length measurement, this **edit modal** follows the same UI design and functionality as the **creation modal**, detailed in the "Annotate Toolbar" chapter.
