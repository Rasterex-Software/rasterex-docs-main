<!--<img  src={arrow1} alt="arrow1" />-->

The interface is subdivided into four sections that allow users to view and manage various properties of the arrow annotation:

### 1. Arrow Style  
Users can select the style of the arrow by choosing from the following options:  
- Filled at both ends  
- Filled at a single end  
- Open at both ends  
- Open at a single end  

### 2. Colors  
Users can change the color of the arrow by selecting from predefined colors or using the color picker to choose a custom color.

### 3. Thickness  
Allows users to adjust the arrowâ€™s line thickness using a slider, with a range from 0 to 12 pts.

### 4. Snap  
The snap parameter determines whether the arrow markup should align with parts of the drawing.  
- **Snap Enabled**: The arrow will adhere to specific elements or lines in the drawing.  
- **Snap Disabled**: The arrow can be placed freely without snapping to any particular part of the document.

By toggling the snap feature, users can choose whether their arrow aligns precisely or moves independently within the document.
