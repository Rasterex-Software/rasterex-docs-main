title: "Drawing Annotation: Highlighter Editing"
---

import highlighter from "./img/highlighter-editing/highlighter-editing.png";

<img style={{height: "300px"}}  src={highlighter} alt="highlighter" />

The editing of the highlighter annotation differs slightly from other drawing tools and includes options specific to the highlighter. In the highlighter editing modal, users can access a single **Details** tab with the following parameters:

- **Opacity**  
  Allows users to view and adjust the opacity of the highlighter markup using a slider with a range of 0% to 100%.

- **Color**  
  Lets users change the color of the highlighter markup by selecting a predefined color or using the color picker to choose a custom color.
