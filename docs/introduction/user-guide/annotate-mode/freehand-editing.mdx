title: Freehand and Polyline Editing
---

import freehand from "./img/freehand-editing/freehand-editing.png";

<img style={{height: "300px"}} src={freehand} alt="Freehand editing" />

Unlike the highlighter, the freehand and polyline annotations share the same editing pattern, and the edit modal for both types is identical. The following options are available in the editing modal for freehand and polyline annotations:

- **Thickness**  
  Allows users to view and adjust the line thickness using a slider with a range of 0 to 12 pts.

- **Style**  
  Enables users to view and change the line style by selecting one of the predefined styles available in the styles dropdown.

- **Color**  
  Lets users change the color of the freehand drawing or polyline markup by choosing from predefined colors or using the color picker to select a custom color.
